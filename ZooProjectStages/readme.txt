Stage 1: Implementing the UML
Stage 2: Demonstrating encapsulation: Adding "location" field to "Zoo" class and getter and setter
Stage 3: Adding constructors (using "setLocation" and "this") to "Zoo" class and overriding "toString" method in "Zoo" class
Stage 4: Extending "ZooApp" class to play with "Zoo" references and objects
Stage 5: Passing object reference and primitive (both by value) as parameters to "changeZoo" method in "Zoo" class; adding "avgVisitors" field and "changeZoo" method call to "ZooApp" class
Stage 6: Creating "Manager" object (and passing "this" as parameter) in "doSomething" method in "Zoo" class and adding "sayHello" method call; adding "doSomething" method call to "Zoo" class constructor; adding constructor to "Manager" class; adding "sayHello" method with "return" statement (to stop method execution) to "Manager" class
Stage 7: Adding static field "numZoosCreated" to "Zoo" class; increasing "numZoosCreated" in Zoo class constructor; adding "numZoosCreated" getter to Zoo class; Check "numZoosCreated" in "ZooApp" class
Stage 8: Adding "test" method to "ZooApp" class, and calling it from the "main" method
